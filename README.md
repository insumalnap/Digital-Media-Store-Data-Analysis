# Digital Media Store Data Analysis

The project aims to address business challenges faced by a fictitious digital media store, Chinook, by providing data-driven solutions. The goal of this project is to provide insights that can help Chinook improve its marketing campaigns, attract new customers, increase sales revenue, and retain its current customer base.

The analysis focused on five key problems:
- Marketing Campaign
- Sourcing Music Selection
- Media Format Selection
- Employee Performance
- Customer Loyalty Program.

The analysis is conducted using SQL and Python, with pandas and matplotlib libraries used for data manipulation and visualization. 

The data used in this project is from the [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) database, created by Leandro R. Rocha.
